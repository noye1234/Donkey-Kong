//ex 2 
The feature we added, as we are three students working on this project,
 allows selecting Mario's icon and replacing it with other icons chosen by the user.

If Mario or the Princess are not on the screen, the screen automatically skips and moves to the next level.

If there are two Marios, the screen is disqualified. However, if there are two Princesses, the real Princess takes the position of the last Princess character that was entered.

he function that loads the screen automatically completes the outer frame.

If Mario falls on the Q frame, he is disqualified.
## Additional Features Approved for Bonus Points

## Decisions Made During Assignment Development
1. When Mario loses a life, his points reset.
2. Mario can jump once while falling and move sideways.
3. If Mario reaches Pauline, he gets 200 points added to his final score.
4. To climb ladders, press the 'W' key as Mario does not climb automatically.
5. Mario can exit the ladder mid-climb using the left and right arrow keys.
6. When pausing the game with 'ESC', a pause message appears. Pressing 'ESC' again resumes the game, but pressing any other key shows a game over message.

## Additional Features Approved for Bonus Points
1. Jumping over a barrel adds 50 points to Mario's score.
2. We designed the opening screen using ASCII art.

3. Added a floor that randomly decides the direction of the barrels (approved without bonus points).
for example "<==========<"
```this floor sent the barrels right 
"<==========>" 
and this floor sent the barrels to left or right in random decision
